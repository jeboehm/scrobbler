# scrobbler

This is a [last.fm](http://www.last.fm) scrobbler, intended for
use on the [Parrot ASTEROID](http://www.parrot.com/de/produkte/asteroid-range/) platform (car audio with ANDROID 2.x).

Unfortunately, I had to wait about [one year for a necessary firmware update](https://devzone.parrot.com/boards/8/topics/show/976)
and in the meanwhile I lost interest in this topic, so I never tested the app.

For learning purposes only!
